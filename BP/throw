!
! Global subroutine !throw used to throw exceptions.  This is an attempt to
! emulate the ability of other languages to throw and catch exceptions.
! Throw is a wrapper to allow the syntax:
!
!   throw( MyException )
!
! in code, it then "raises" an exception via the raise method of the object
! instantiated as MyException from an object call:
!
!   MyException = object( "MyException.class" )
!
! Any exception class must inherit the base Exception class.  The base class
! defines methods "raise" and "caught" to be use be the wrapper subroutines
! and functions.
